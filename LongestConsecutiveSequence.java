* Given this dynamic programming problem in an interview. Couldn't do it then, so here is a solution now.
Find the largest sequence of consecutive numbers that are adjacent to one another in a matrix. The matrix is a 2D matrix with sides of length n and containing m elements. Each element is a unique number in the range of [1..m] (inclusive).
An example:
n = 3, m = 9
9 8 4 7 3 5 1 2 6 A longest consecutive sequence: [1,2,3]
return a one dimensional array of intergers take in the matrix as a parameter
